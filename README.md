# EOS Token Ranking

## Introduction

Writing a ranked eos token list, in my personal opionion. 

Objective:

- ⭐️⭐️⭐️：potential and high quality
- ⭐️⭐️：medium, and remain to be observed
- ⭐️：trash and worthless

Features: 

- Whitepaper
- Official Website
- GitHub
- The problem to solve
- The way to reach the target
- Token distribution 
- The trend of marketing

I will follow the [Newdex token launched announcement](https://newdex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003160531-Token-Developments) to update the newest token ranking. 
Try my best to cover all of tokens launched at Newdex.

## Ranking

### ⭐️⭐️⭐️

---

#### [POW](https://github.com/NedAmarril/eosiopowcoin)

Do the mining things by eos cpu, just like EIDOS, but it has some advantage against EIDOS.  

Advantage:

+ The mining method is likely with bitcoin, for example, the max_supply and additional issue is stay the same with bition.
+ No preserving shares for team. 
+ The Authority of its contract account is set by eosio, so it is decentralised. 

Refs: [bloks](https://bloks.io/tokens/POW-eos-eosiopowcoin) 

#### [EIDOS](https://enumivo.org/get-free-eidos)

token distributuon: 20% for team , 80% for the air-drop.

the method of EIDOS's air-drop is creative, 
it is mined through transferring token to EIDOS contract account, 
and the contract account will return the same amount of token back. 
at the same time, it will transfer some EIDOS token to you. the mining will be working until 15 months later. 

source code of this project is open-sourced. it can be found in [github.com/enumivo/eidos](https://github.com/enumivo/eidos).

when this project began, the CPU price on the eos chain increased quickly. that is very interesting.

the founder of this project wants to solve the problem about eos resource lying idle. 
in my opinion, this is very ok, because eos's main value is about the vote and resource on the chain.
if the source value in the eos chain going up. the ecology will going better. 
so this project is benefit for eos. it is worth being watched.

#### [YAS](https://enumivo.org/blog/2019/11/28/yas-token-minting-and-burning)

YAS was made by the same team of EIDOS. it is interesting idea too. 
YAS can be transform to EIDOS, vice verse. 
When the YAS token issued amount reach 90M, the mainnet of YAS will be launched. 
The team of EIDOS is most creative team at the eos-mainnet, so i think this project deserve attention greatly. 

If you are interested in it, you can look into details in [YAS Network](https://enumivo.org/blog/2019/11/24/yas-network)  

#### [USDT](https://bloks.io/account/tethertether)

stable-token is the necessity of digital exchange, but by now, USDT is still the most popular stable-coin.

after all, in the area of stable-coin, the decentrelized solution can not compare with the historic brand company, even though the tech of new stable-coin is more advanced.

in my opinion, USDT-in-eos is critical for the liquidity in eos. 

```
069ce18d	Oct 04, 2019 09:24:02 PM	
tethertether issued 5,000,000 USDT to bitfinexdep1
da204c17	Jul 30, 2019 07:17:06 PM	
tethertether issued 250,000 USDT to tethertether
```

> updated at 2020-01:
> now 5,251,000 USDT has been issued, and the recent issue time is 20191004, is a long time to now. so we can pay attention to the next issue time. 
maybe it can bring something exciting to the eos-chain. 

```
0c67c881	Sep 05, 2020 03:21:52 PM	
tethertether issued 50,000,000 USDT to bitfinexdep1
1a95315f	Sep 04, 2020 07:20:31 PM	
tethertether issued 25,000,000 USDT to bitfinexdep1
bc75c247	Aug 29, 2020 05:03:51 PM	
tethertether issued 10,000,000 USDT to bitfinexdep1
```

> updated at 2020-11
> now 90,251,000 [USDT](https://bloks.io/tokens/USDT-eos-tethertether) has been issued, and the recent issue time is 2020-09-05. 
> i guess that it is related to the [defibox](https://defibox.io), anyway, just keep watching on it.

#### [USN](https://bloks.io/account/danchortoken)

Decentralized stable coin is hot recently, USN is one of them. 
but i think USDT which has the historic credit is better than USN. 
USN = smart contract + Newdex brand quality guarantee. 

#### pEOS

so far, that should be one of the most smooth whitepapers which i ever read, very concise. it means to solve the privacy problem which is one of the user's pain point. clearly, it will develop untraceable transactions for it. similar products are zCash etc.
and pEOS's advantage is based on eos chain, so it can reuse the ecological and high-performance advantages of eos. 

air-drops are also more sincere. 80% of the air-drops are given to eos holders, and the team keeps 20%.

the white papers also mentioned that after the smart contract is ready, the contract account will become immutable account, and open source the contract code. 


#### [SOV](https://www.soveos.one/)

SOV is a very creative token on the EOS chain, with a very new concept: Deflation.  

The key points are as follows:

because of the deflation, when trading, SOV tokens will be burn at the rate, until the total amount drops from 1 billion to 21 million. 

82% of the airdrops are given to the EOS creation account, and each creation account can receive 5k SOV, so it is highly decentralized. 

its contract is the first immutable contract on the EOS chain, that is, the owner key authority of contract account has been set to the eosio account, and it only can be modified if the blockproducer node votes more than 15/21. 

#### [NDX](https://newdex.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360021256251-Newdex平台生态通证介绍)

The token of Newdex, and its selling point is buy-back, just like BNB. 
But Newdex's much smaller than Binance. so its buy-back is not as attractive as BNB. 

But according to my observation, Newdex Team are doing the right thing and working hard. so it has some potential. it deserves to be paid attention to .

#### [BOX](https://danchor.io/)

it is DeFi application platform on EOS, initied and managed by the Defibox Foundation, and also funded and supported by Newdex. 
so this project deserves attention and needs some time to oberve.

#### [pTokens](https://ptokens.io/)

pTokens has a Good sense of technology. [GitHub](https://github.com/provable-things), it aims to build a cross-chain DeFi platform. 
there are many tokens on that, such as pBTC, pETH, pLTC and so on. 

it is a good idea but it need a lot of effort to make it come true. 

#### [AMT](https://enumivo.org/blog/2020/3/1/amt-anti-mining-token-airdrop)

Produced by the EIDOS team too, contrary to EIDOS token, mining according to the amount of REX, to solve the problem that the current EOS CPU mining affects the normal 
production stability. 
but the weird thing is that the mining period of AMT is very short. it comes out in April, and ends on May 1st. its popularity is not as good as EIDOS. 

everyone should be tired of such concepts. 

#### [EOSLP](https://enumivo.org/blog/2019/11/7/more-codex-details)

EOSLP is the token in [Codex](https://enumivo.org/blog/2019/11/7/more-codex-details), it can be used to earn the fees in EIDOS/EOS trading pair. 
But Codex is hard to succeed, so EOSLP has a tough future. 

#### [POWX](https://powh.fund/)

The Exchange based on POW, its official website is well, but its direction is just so-so. i am so wonder why so many token builder want to build the exchange? building exchange  is so hard to succeed. 


#### [SPEECH](https://github.com/cantstopwondering/speech)

It is a very funny token, and it has a GitHub ReadMe style technology.
It is easy to understand, likely with EIDOS. it means to it can be mined by calling contract. and its contract api's name is 'speech'.

The beginning of the Readme is "Dear all helpless EOS holders ..."

What's even more funny is that the author also went to eosio/eos's [issue](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/8395#event-2921899635) to promote it. 

I feel b1 should be very 'what the fuck...'.

The introduction of this project says 'Silence is silver, speech is golden.', funny, haha.

Imagine if this project is as popular as EIDOS, i don not know the [Actions](https://bloks.io/account/b1) records to be collected How many 'greets' from all over the world.

that is so funny.

#### [RUTM](https://github.com/baromjon/ramupthemoon)

Basically, it is the continuation of EIDOS's creativity.
The highlight is that GitHub instructions and open-sourced code have a little geek style. 

But that sentence is : those who learn from me live, those who copy me ?

However, it is still a sincere contract for now, so keep watching.

#### pixEOS

It has a good sense of creativity. a brief introduction is to provide the only canvas in the world. 
and anyone can spend their eos to fill pixel any color in that canvas. and the eos cost of each pixel will become higher and higher as more and more people draw it. 

Among them, the pixEOS token is the intermediate currency of fee. The price is strongly related to the frequency of use of this canvas, and the frequency of use is strongly related to the number of people watching this canvas.

At present, the price performance is average. but the highlight is that the creativily is really awesome and it is worth learning.

#### [EMT](https://emanate.live/discover)

It has a good official website, this app is more like a good music communication site, the purpose is to build a platform for music creators and listeners.

EMT token is only a decentralized stock or vote of this platform. As an application, i think it is a good direction, but whether it really needs to be decentralized, i think it may not be necessary. 

overall, the advantage is that the website is highly completed and the team is good, but the disadvantage is that blockchain may not be needed to solve this problem.

#### PIZZA-USDE

PIZZA-USD is a stable-coin system based on EOS, yet another stable-coin solution. but is USDT really that bad? 

For ordinary users, the habit is hard to change, and USDT is the habit. in my opinion, the other stablecoins (including PIZZA-USDE) will have hope after the USDT has big problems. Otherwise, there is little hope.

And after looking into the distribution rules of PIZZA, i dont think it has good decentralization thinking.

To add, i suddenly found that there are many blockchain teams in Xiaman, this is also a product of the Xiamen blockchain team.

#### ZigZag

ZigZag is a twin coin. The background is that the current blockchain stablecoins such as USDT are not decentralized and stable, but are controlled by humans. ZigZag wants to achieve stability through smart contract and Zig is the stablecoin of each chain, Zag is the voting right of the smart contract, which means that the price of the former is stable. 
and the price of the latter may increase as the volume of the former increases. 
But i feel that this goal is a bit big, the idea is good, and it was born for decentralization. but do the users really have this demand? i doubt it.

#### [SVX](https://newdex.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360039219772-Newdex%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF-SVX-EOS-%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%AF%B9)

SOVDEX 是 SOV 团队做的去中心化交易所，对 SOV 我是看好的，但是对于 SOVDEX 不看好，交易所已经有了 Newdex，不理解为啥还需要为代币专门做一个 Dex。有些为了做而做。

### ⭐️⭐️

---

#### [DOP](https://bloks.io/account/dolphintoken#keys)

#### [PUML](https://puml.io/)

health concept

#### [GEN](https://genpool.io/)

Aims to provider the value of votes, so voters can get money from its eos vote. its direction is ok, but it is hard way to make it popular, because the exchanges will also do the same thing, so this is a highly competitive field. 

#### [POOL](https://bloks.io/account/stpool.eos)

starteos 的股份币？会员币？没找到这个币的介绍，也没看出发这个币的必要性？

#### [EOSDAC]

可能是一个eos上的乌托邦，理想是美好的，现实是残酷的。

#### [VIG](https://vig.ai/VIGOR.pdf)/[VIGOR](https://vigor.ai/)

The official website and whitepaper are both good, trying to solve the debit and credit. the direction of it is good too. 

but the token distribution is not decentralized enough. 

#### [BET](https://eosbet.io/)

没找到白皮书，看官网完整性还可以。后面有空再详细分析。值得关注。

#### SBET

没有正规的白皮书是减分项，但是网站的完成度高，操作体验不错是加分项，可以质押SBET参与分红，目前的价格来看分红利润不错，需要再详细分析一下具体每天收益数据。整体感觉不错，但是需要确认sbet的分发规则，目前资料不太全，感觉并不透明，可能存在大户砸盘风险。

#### DICE

博彩概念，其实区块链确实是最适合博彩的平台，但是dice感觉想做成博彩入口，但是需要爆款，目前来看，似乎SBET更可能成为爆款。因为博彩范围太广。
看了下dice的代笔分发规则，去中心化程度不足，大量代笔等着被挖出来，通缩性不足。

更偏向是博彩平台的分红票权，币值和博彩平台发展和规则制定者强相关，大资金应该不敢进入。

#### TPT

居然到现在还没把白皮书发布出来。TokenPocket 确实是目前 eos 链上最好用的钱包，没有之一，但是这个 TPT 的白皮书也没有，个人猜测去中心诚意不足，应该会作为类似股份激励的方向来运营。

#### [GOVRN](https://consortium.live/)

场景是 DAC 的投票优化，官网完成度还可以，但是还是无法理解的是目前 DAC 如此小众，没看到什么前景，专门为 DAC 做这些东西，其实增加了很多复杂度和理解成本，收益有限，个人认为这个事情的价值有限。

#### [WAX](https://wax.io/)

区块链上的阿里巴巴？官网完成度不错，目标也很远大，但是区块链现在如果类比互联网的话，应该是属于连 TCP/IP 协议都还没完成的状态，这个时候做商务平台，感觉时机不太成熟，希望不大。

#### KARMA

社交概念，其实不太理解为什么国外的区块链项目都这么心心念念社交。用karma来作为社交互动行为的激励积分，来引导社区氛围往好的方向发展。但是这里有个不可调和的矛盾，社区需要养，而如果用积分来激励的话，大家来社区是为了赚币，那这个社区不可能往好的方向发展。
所以目前觉得，社交积分激励方向，应该不是区块链优势的方向。

#### [PAXE](https://www.paxos.com/pax/)

这个币有点唬，目测是类似USDT的稳定币，不是很感兴趣。

#### [OGX](https://ogx.network/#/)

The official website is alright, but the overall feeling is not good, and its roadmap is not very reliable. 

#### HVT

区块链上的找工作平台，白皮书写的不错，但是方向确实还是悬，毕竟，找工作平台能成功的核心不在于是否是去中心化或者是否是链上公证，也不是什么回馈社区，而是把撮合做好，区块链对这个方向的创业没有太大帮助，应该是没啥戏。

#### EPRA

以太坊上PRA代币的双胞胎币，从腾讯广告团队成员出来创业的区块链项目，思路就是让广告投放上链，让广告主的广告费直接分成到用户端，有点类似互联网的趣头条类似的增长的打法。
但是问题在于，这样还是互联网项目的思路来做区块链，非常容易导致社区聚集一帮薅羊毛的用户群体，不利于长远发展。团队不错，但是方向可能还需要摸索。

#### [STEEMP](https://bloks.io/account/steemoneosio)

基于 steem-engine 上的一个代币，对于 steem 不太了解，目测像是 steem 上的币在 eos 链上映射的 1比1 的代币，观察吧。

#### [WEED](http://weedcash.io/)

和 STEEMP 类似，一币发多链，看不太懂，也是观察吧。

#### [LMC](http://luckyminer.one/)

其实就是基于区块链的彩票，我理解方向是没问题的，但是从网站上来看，团队技术实在是太粗糙了，如果是靠谱技术团队应该能到3分或者4分。

#### DAPP

主要亮点是rRAM 我的理解就是作为开发者和 eos ram 的一个中间件，主要是提升eos的开发效率。但是个人觉得这个并不是 eos 开发的痛点。对这个方向持怀疑态度。

#### ATHENA

目前看白皮书，写的太恢弘壮大，感觉不太现实。而且描述的想解决的痛点也比较宽泛，解决办法并不明确。
大概感觉就是白皮书像是把各个概念都谈一下，然后拼凑起来的感觉。没太 get 到想解决的点。

#### SENSE

白皮书分上下两篇，发布在medium上，看完后感觉一般，没有惊喜，和猜想的一样，就是社交积分管理类似，优点就是加密社交，通过token做积分管理和社区自治，token的规则很多很复杂，没有耐心仔细研究，个人感觉，这个方向，还是带着互联网的思维做区块链，个人不太看好。未来区块链的突破，肯定是做成了一些互联网无法做到的事情。如果还是带着互联网思维做，概率不大。

#### [VTX](https://volentix.io/)

跨链概念，官网完成度还可以，下载了一个mac版本的verto钱包，钱包的完成度也还可以。  
缺点是概念太大，方向不太靠谱，本来交易所就是最好的跨链应用，用户并没有再下载一个难用的跨链钱包来的意愿。  
目前来看，概念太大的，失败概率也大。

#### PGL

白皮书简直就是游戏说明书，看完没有看到什么亮点，很普通的游戏，只不过把游戏金币换成token。还是那个观点，游戏的核心在于好玩和消遣时间，才能聚集人气，有人气后游戏内资产才有增值潜力。所以目前来看，没发现值得二次阅读的亮点。

#### SPIN

dice平台上的积分代币，没太大意思，主要是起到比较喜庆的作用。

#### BAP

又一个菠菜游戏，同质化太严重，不看好。

#### [BBT](https://blockbase.network/)

基于区块链的数据库，目前这个阶段做这个事情，希望不大。

#### [PYP](https://chattle.vip/#/)

> 「块信」以区块链IM（即时通讯）作为平台载体，为用户提供数字货币钱包游戏娱乐电子商务等优质服务，一站式满足您的所有需求。

看到这个介绍，就觉得没戏了。区块链IM还没出成熟的产品，就开始用它作为平台载体？恩？

#### [MARF](https://marf.io/)

从 MARF [官网](https://marf.io/) 看不到任何和 [Newdex上币介绍](https://newdex.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360038039172-Newdex%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF-MARF-EOS-%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%AF%B9) 对得上的资料。what happened?

#### [DFS](https://www.defis.network/)

defi concept, but its purpose and vision is too huge to achieve. i don't think it will last long. 

#### [CRG and MICH](https://newdex.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360038072512-Newdex%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF-CRG-EOS-MICH-EOS-%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%AF%B9)

慈善捐赠概念，目的让捐赠者也有利可图？这个听起来不太能理解。2分观察吧。

#### [TDCE](https://newdex.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360038290492-Newdex%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF-TDCE-EOS-%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%AF%B9)

社交媒体概念，实在不看好。2分观察。

#### [HUB](https://bloks.io/account/eoshubtokens)

did not find its website.

#### [dEOS](https://eosfi.io/)

### ⭐️

---

#### [TRO](https://treos.io/)

电商代币，这官网仿佛 90 年代的电商网站，让我差点穿越回去。

#### [LOOT](https://bloks.io/account/lootglobcore)

#### [DMC](https://bloks.io/account/weedcashntwk)

训龙大师游戏币，持币分红，方向不看好，游戏是用来娱乐的，不是用来赚钱的。

#### [DAPPPRO](https://bloks.io/account/dapp.pro)

没看到更多介绍，只能凭直觉或者说嗅觉来判断是韭菜包子了。

#### EATCOIN (https://eatschools.com/index.php/about-us/)

概念是教育激励，学生通过学习网上课程获得代币，教师通过收获学生好评获得代币。
区块链时代的O2O，就是幻想什么项目发个代币就能起飞。显然是不可能的。

#### BID

飞鸟游戏，官网打开后，需要邀请码才能进入。晕。

#### NUT

又一个稳定币解决方案，感觉对稳定币提不起兴趣，也不理解为什么这么多团队都在做这个方向，虽然技术含量高，但是感觉并不是用户需求所驱动。没有深究的欲望。

#### [CHT](https://cryptoheroes.net/)

游戏有关的概念币，不看好，感觉游戏类的币，都有点走飘了，游戏的本质在于娱乐，在于消费和花钱，不在于增值。
而且看开盘砸成这样，应该也不是什么好鸟。

#### [BBT](https://github.com/blockbasenetwork/documentation/blob/master/WhitePaper-tldr.md)

解决的需求不明确，想在区块链上面做数据库，45%的币空投，其他的币全部用来做项目建设，也就是类似发工资。但是项目建设的前景又不清楚，目前看成功的概率不大。

#### [HBG](https://hbg.finance/)
