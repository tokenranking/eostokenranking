## Ranking

#### [USDT](https://bloks.io/account/tethertether)

stable-token is the necessity of digital exchange, but by now, USDT is still the most popular stable-coin.

after all, in the area of stable-coin, the decentrelized solution can not compare with the historic brand company, even though the tech of new stable-coin is more advanced.

in my opinion, USDT-in-eos is critical for the liquidity in eos.

#### [BOX](https://defibox.io)

it is DeFi application platform on EOS, initied and managed by the [Defibox](https://defibox.io) Foundation, and also funded and supported by Newdex. 
so this project deserves attention and needs some time to oberve.

[swap.defi contract](https://bloks.io/account/swap.defi)

swap contract example: 

[swap: eos -> usdt](https://bloks.io/transaction/4feedf164a114829dc1f2cf302f2cd27ed959232a0bff85611d22a686e8c4c25?tab=traces)

#### [USN](https://bloks.io/account/danchortoken)

Decentralized stable coin is hot recently, USN is one of them. 
but i think USDT which has the historic credit is better than USN. 
USN = smart contract + Newdex brand quality guarantee. 

|Date|Generated|Stakes|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|2020-11-29|2507491 USN|1588474 EOS|

#### [NDX](https://support.newdex.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021256251-Introduction-of-Newdex-Platform-Ecological-Token)

The token of Newdex, and its selling point is buy-back, just like BNB. 
But Newdex's much smaller than Binance. so its buy-back is not as attractive as BNB. 

But according to my observation, Newdex Team are doing the right thing and working hard. so it has some potential. it deserves to be paid attention to .

#### pEOS

so far, that should be one of the most smooth whitepapers which i ever read, very concise. it means to solve the privacy problem which is one of the user's pain point. clearly, it will develop untraceable transactions for it. similar products are zCash etc.
and pEOS's advantage is based on eos chain, so it can reuse the ecological and high-performance advantages of eos. 

air-drops are also more sincere. 80% of the air-drops are given to eos holders, and the team keeps 20%.

the white papers also mentioned that after the smart contract is ready, the contract account will become immutable account, and open source the contract code. 

#### [SOV](https://www.soveos.one/)

SOV is a very creative token on the EOS chain, with a very new concept: Deflation.  

The key points are as follows:

because of the deflation, when trading, SOV tokens will be burn at the rate, until the total amount drops from 1 billion to 21 million. 

82% of the airdrops are given to the EOS creation account, and each creation account can receive 5k SOV, so it is highly decentralized. 

its contract is the first immutable contract on the EOS chain, that is, the owner key authority of contract account has been set to the eosio account, and it only can be modified if the blockproducer node votes more than 15/21. 

#### [pTokens](https://ptokens.io/)

pTokens has a Good sense of technology. [GitHub](https://github.com/provable-things), it aims to build a cross-chain DeFi platform. 
there are many tokens on that, such as pBTC, pETH, pLTC and so on. 

it is a good idea but it need a lot of effort to make it come true.

#### [POW](https://github.com/NedAmarril/eosiopowcoin)

Do the mining things by eos cpu, just like EIDOS, but it has some advantage against EIDOS.  

Advantage:

+ The mining method is likely with bitcoin, for example, the max_supply and additional issue is stay the same with bition.
+ No preserving shares for team. 
+ The Authority of its contract account is set by eosio, so it is decentralised. 

Refs: [bloks](https://bloks.io/tokens/POW-eos-eosiopowcoin) 

#### [EIDOS](https://enumivo.org/get-free-eidos)

token distributuon: 20% for team , 80% for the air-drop.

the method of EIDOS's air-drop is creative, 
it is mined through transferring token to EIDOS contract account, 
and the contract account will return the same amount of token back. 
at the same time, it will transfer some EIDOS token to you. the mining will be working until 15 months later. 

source code of this project is open-sourced. it can be found in [github.com/enumivo/eidos](https://github.com/enumivo/eidos).

when this project began, the CPU price on the eos chain increased quickly. that is very interesting.

the founder of this project wants to solve the problem about eos resource lying idle. 
in my opinion, this is very ok, because eos's main value is about the vote and resource on the chain.
if the source value in the eos chain going up. the ecology will going better. 
so this project is benefit for eos. it is worth being watched.

#### [YAS](https://enumivo.org/blog/2019/11/28/yas-token-minting-and-burning)

YAS was made by the same team of EIDOS. it is interesting idea too. 
YAS can be transform to EIDOS, vice verse. 
When the YAS token issued amount reach 90M, the mainnet of YAS will be launched. 
The team of EIDOS is most creative team at the eos-mainnet, so i think this project deserve attention greatly. 

If you are interested in it, you can look into details in [YAS Network](https://enumivo.org/blog/2019/11/24/yas-network)  

#### [AMT](https://enumivo.org/blog/2020/3/1/amt-anti-mining-token-airdrop)

Produced by the EIDOS team too, contrary to EIDOS token, mining according to the amount of REX, to solve the problem that the current EOS CPU mining affects the normal 
production stability. 
but the weird thing is that the mining period of AMT is very short. it comes out in April, and ends on May 1st. its popularity is not as good as EIDOS. 

everyone should be tired of such concepts. 

#### [EOSLP](https://enumivo.org/blog/2019/11/7/more-codex-details)

EOSLP is the token in [Codex](https://enumivo.org/blog/2019/11/7/more-codex-details), it can be used to earn the fees in EIDOS/EOS trading pair. 
But Codex is hard to succeed, so EOSLP has a tough future. 

#### [POWX](https://powh.fund/)

The Exchange based on POW, its official website is well, but its direction is just so-so. i am so wonder why so many token builder want to build the exchange? building exchange  is so hard to succeed. 


#### [SPEECH](https://github.com/cantstopwondering/speech)

It is a very funny token, and it has a GitHub ReadMe style technology.
It is easy to understand, likely with EIDOS. it means to it can be mined by calling contract. and its contract api's name is 'speech'.

The beginning of the Readme is "Dear all helpless EOS holders ..."

What's even more funny is that the author also went to eosio/eos's [issue](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/8395#event-2921899635) to promote it. 

I feel b1 should be very 'what the fuck...'.

The introduction of this project says 'Silence is silver, speech is golden.', funny, haha.

Imagine if this project is as popular as EIDOS, i don not know the [Actions](https://bloks.io/account/b1) records to be collected How many 'greets' from all over the world.

that is so funny.

#### [RUTM](https://github.com/baromjon/ramupthemoon)

Basically, it is the continuation of EIDOS's creativity.
The highlight is that GitHub instructions and open-sourced code have a little geek style. 

But that sentence is : those who learn from me live, those who copy me ?

However, it is still a sincere contract for now, so keep watching.

#### pixEOS

It has a good sense of creativity. a brief introduction is to provide the only canvas in the world. 
and anyone can spend their eos to fill pixel any color in that canvas. and the eos cost of each pixel will become higher and higher as more and more people draw it. 

Among them, the pixEOS token is the intermediate currency of fee. The price is strongly related to the frequency of use of this canvas, and the frequency of use is strongly related to the number of people watching this canvas.

At present, the price performance is average. but the highlight is that the creativily is really awesome and it is worth learning.

#### [EMT](https://emanate.live/discover)

It has a good official website, this app is more like a good music communication site, the purpose is to build a platform for music creators and listeners.

EMT token is only a decentralized stock or vote of this platform. As an application, i think it is a good direction, but whether it really needs to be decentralized, i think it may not be necessary. 

overall, the advantage is that the website is highly completed and the team is good, but the disadvantage is that blockchain may not be needed to solve this problem.

#### PIZZA-USDE

PIZZA-USD is a stable-coin system based on EOS, yet another stable-coin solution. but is USDT really that bad? 

For ordinary users, the habit is hard to change, and USDT is the habit. in my opinion, the other stablecoins (including PIZZA-USDE) will have hope after the USDT has big problems. Otherwise, there is little hope.

And after looking into the distribution rules of PIZZA, i dont think it has good decentralization thinking.

To add, i suddenly found that there are many blockchain teams in Xiaman, this is also a product of the Xiamen blockchain team.

#### ZigZag

ZigZag is a twin coin. The background is that the current blockchain stablecoins such as USDT are not decentralized and stable, but are controlled by humans. ZigZag wants to achieve stability through smart contract and Zig is the stablecoin of each chain, Zag is the voting right of the smart contract, which means that the price of the former is stable. 
and the price of the latter may increase as the volume of the former increases. 
But i feel that this goal is a bit big, the idea is good, and it was born for decentralization. but do the users really have this demand? i doubt it.

#### [SVX](https://newdex.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360039219772-Newdex%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF-SVX-EOS-%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%AF%B9)

SOVDEX is a decentralized exchange made by SOV team. 
I am optimistic about SOV but I am not opmistic about SVX
I don't think anyone should build a exchange for one token. And Newdex already is good enough for EOS tokens.


### ⭐️⭐️

---

#### [DOP](https://bloks.io/account/dolphintoken#keys)

#### [PUML](https://puml.io/)

health concept

#### [GEN](https://genpool.io/)

Aims to provider the value of votes, so voters can get money from its eos vote. its direction is ok, but it is hard way to make it popular, because the exchanges will also do the same thing, so this is a highly competitive field. 

#### [POOL](https://bloks.io/account/stpool.eos)

Didn't find the introduction of this coin, and did not see the necessary of starting this coin?

#### EOSDAC

It may be a utopia on EOS, Ideals are beautiful and reality is cruel.

#### [VIG](https://vig.ai/VIGOR.pdf)/[VIGOR](https://vigor.ai/)

The official website and whitepaper are both good, trying to solve the debit and credit. the direction of it is good too. 

but the token distribution is not decentralized enough. 

#### [BET](https://eosbet.io/)

Didn't find the whitepaper, but the offical website is well, i will analyze it in detail later when i have time, worthy of attention.

#### SBET

Its website has a high degree of completion and a good operating experience. 

#### DICE

The concept of gambling, in my opinion, the blockchain is indeed the best platform for gambling, 
and DICE wants to be a gambling portal. at present, SBET is more likely to become a hit. 

After reading the DICE's token distribution rules, the degree of decentralization is insufficent, 
and a large number of coins are waiting to be mined, and the deflation is insufficient.

#### TPT

Actually, TokenPocket is indeed the best wallet on the EOS chain at the present. 

#### [GOVRN](https://consortium.live/)

The scenario is the optimization of DAC voting. The completion of the official website is not bad, but it is still not understood that the current DAC is so small and there is no prospect. Doing these things specifically for DAC actually adds a lot of complexity and understanding costs, and the benefits are limited. , I personally think that the value of this matter is limited.

#### KARMA

The concept of socialization, in fact, does not understand why foreign blockchain projects are so eager to socialize. Use karma as the incentive points for social interaction behaviors to guide the community atmosphere in a good direction. But there is an irreconcilable contradiction here. The community needs to support it. If points are used to motivate, everyone comes to the community to earn money, and the community cannot develop in a good direction.
Therefore, it is currently felt that the direction of social points incentives should not be the direction of blockchain advantage.

#### [PAXE](https://www.paxos.com/pax/)

This coin is a bit ridiculous. It is a stable coin similar to USDT, so I am not very interested.

#### [OGX](https://ogx.network/#/)

The official website is alright, but the overall feeling is not good, and its roadmap is not very reliable. 

#### HVT

The job search platform on the blockchain is well written in the white paper, but the direction is indeed still hanging. After all, the core of the success of the job search platform is not whether it is decentralized or notarized on the chain, nor is it giving back to the community. It is to do a good job of matching. Blockchain is not very helpful to entrepreneurship in this direction. It should be nothing.

#### EPRA

The twin coin of the PRA token on Ethereum, a blockchain project started by members of Tencent's advertising team, the idea is to put advertisements on the chain, so that advertisers' advertising fees are directly divided into users, similar to the Internet's interesting headlines. The growth of play.
But the problem is that this is still the idea of an Internet project to build a blockchain, which is very easy to cause the community to gather a bunch of woolen user groups, which is not conducive to long-term development. The team is good, but the direction may need to be explored.

#### [STEEMP](https://bloks.io/account/steemoneosio)

Based on a token on steem-engine, I don't know much about steem. Visually, it looks like a 1:1 token mapped from steem on the eos chain. Observe.

#### [WEED](http://weedcash.io/)

it is hard to understand.

#### [LMC](http://luckyminer.one/)

In fact, it is a lottery based on the blockchain. I understand that the direction is okay, but from the website, the team technology is too rough. If it is a reliable technical team, it should be able to score 3 or 4 points.

#### DAPP

rRAM? as the intermedia between developer and eos-ram? not the key point.

#### ATHENA

Looking at the white paper so far, it is too grand and strong, and it feels unrealistic. Moreover, the pain points that I want to solve are relatively broad, and the solution is not clear.
It probably feels like the white paper talks about all the concepts and then puts them together. Not too get to the point I want to solve.

#### SENSE

The white paper is divided into two parts, which are published on medium. After reading it, it feels normal and there are no surprises. As I guess, it is similar to social point management. The advantage is encrypted social interaction. Point management and community autonomy through tokens have many rules. It is complicated, and I have no patience to study it carefully. Personally, I feel that this direction is to do the blockchain with the thinking of the Internet. I am not very optimistic about it. In the future, the breakthrough of blockchain will definitely accomplish something that the Internet cannot do. If you still do it with Internet thinking, the probability is not high.

#### [VTX](https://volentix.io/)

Cross-chain concept, the completion of the official website is not bad, I downloaded a mac version of the verto wallet, the completion of the wallet is also not bad.
The disadvantage is that the concept is too big and the direction is not very reliable. Originally, the exchange was the best cross-chain application, and users did not have the will to download a difficult cross-chain wallet.
At present, the concept is too big, and the probability of failure is also high.


#### PGL

The white paper is simply the game manual. After reading it, I didn't see any bright spots. It is a very ordinary game, but the game coins are exchanged for tokens. Still from that point of view, the core of the game is fun and leisure time to gather popularity, and only after popularity can in-game assets have the potential for value-added. So for now, I haven't found any bright spots worth reading twice.

#### SPIN

#### BAP

Gambling game. that is too much already.

#### [BBT](https://blockbase.network/)

The database based on block. it is hard to succeed at present.

#### [PYP](https://chattle.vip/#/)

"Blockchain" uses blockchain IM (instant messaging) as the platform carrier to provide users with digital currency wallets, games, entertainment, e-commerce and other high-quality services to meet all your needs in one stop.

Seeing this introduction, I feel like it's nowhere. Blockchain IM hasn't produced a mature product yet, has it been used as a platform carrier? Yep?

#### [MARF](https://marf.io/)

#### [DFS](https://www.defis.network/)

defi concept, but its purpose and vision is too huge to achieve. i don't think it will last long. 

#### [CRG and MICH](https://newdex.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360038072512-Newdex%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF-CRG-EOS-MICH-EOS-%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%AF%B9)

The concept of charitable donations, the purpose of making donors profitable? This sounds incomprehensible.

#### [TDCE](https://newdex.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360038290492-Newdex%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF-TDCE-EOS-%E6%96%B0%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%AF%B9)

Social.

#### [HUB](https://bloks.io/account/eoshubtokens)

did not find its website.

#### [dEOS](https://eosfi.io/)

#### [WAX](https://wax.io/)

The ALIBABA on the blockchain? are you kidding me?

### ⭐️

---

#### [TRO](https://treos.io/)

The concept of E-commerse. impossible

#### [LOOT](https://bloks.io/account/lootglobcore)

#### [DMC](https://bloks.io/account/weedcashntwk)

Game Coin.

#### [DAPPPRO](https://bloks.io/account/dapp.pro)

#### [EATCOIN](https://eatschools.com/index.php/about-us/)

The concept is educational incentives. Students earn tokens through online courses, and teachers earn tokens through praise from students.
O2O in the blockchain era is to imagine that any project can take off by issuing a token. Obviously it is impossible.

#### BID

Bird Game.

#### NUT

Stable Coin Solution. Hard to make it work.

#### [CHT](https://cryptoheroes.net/)

Concept coins related to games are not optimistic. It feels that game coins are a little erratic. The essence of games is entertainment, consumption and spending, not value-added.
And seeing the opening smashed like this, it should not be a good bird.

#### [BBT](https://github.com/blockbasenetwork/documentation/blob/master/WhitePaper-tldr.md)

The need to solve is not clear. I want to build a database on the blockchain, 45% of the coins are airdropped, and the other coins are all used for project construction, which is similar to salary payment. However, the prospect of project construction is unclear, and the probability of success is not high at present.
